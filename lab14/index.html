  <h2>Challlenge</h2>

<p> A basic repeat of lab 13, we have to copy a preexisting website to the best of our abilities. The last lab gave me some grief, so I’ve elected to try a website that was a little simpler to pull off. The challenge for this one in my case, was to make a relatively simple layout be impressive anyways. </p>
  <h3>Problems</h3>
<p> An issue that I wanted to avoid that occurred last time was resizing. My last assignment was ultimately a poor example of a working website, as it would become buggy and unusable if a user had a vastly different screen size. I made sure to avoid this problem, by routinely inspecting the website in case one line of code changes everything and by keeping my elements on the smaller side. Another issue is the simplicity of the website. In order to meet standards, I decided to add in a transitional effect. I’ve viewed w3schools to see how it worked, since the original website I’m copying has an interesting transition. Editing the code given was mandatory, as the hover transition would block the “Menu” link.</p>
  <h4>Results</h4>
<p>The resulting copy cat website ended up successful. I’m actually happy with this version, in comparison to lab 13. The transition element works perfectly, the  elements are in their proper locations and the website can resize. The fonts are not completely perfect but they look close enough. </p>
