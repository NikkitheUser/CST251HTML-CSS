  <h2>Challlenge</h2>
<p> Lab 9 allows us to style our background. Specifically, the margins and borders will be stylized with CSS</p>
  <h3>Problems</h3>
<p>Problems that could have arisen from this lab would tend to gravitate towards measurments. Due to the heavy usage of margins, padding and borders we have to keep track of how far did we push a way an element.</p>
  <h4>Results</h4>
<p>By the end, the results show a more presentable lab. The text and images are centered, as opposed to leaning to much on the left edge.  </p>
