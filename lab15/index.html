  <h2>Challlenge</h2>

<p> In this lab, we learned a few new lines of code. This assignment will require us to make an eyesore of a lab. Gradients, shadows, filters and more will have to be added in order to be sufficent.  </p>
  <h3>Problems</h3>
<p> No problems occured during this lab. Compared to the two previous assignments, this was just a basic cakewalk. </p>
  <h4>Results</h4>
<p> The pumpkin image have been roated, and blurred. The london eye has a box shadow and object fitted. The "example text" only has a text shadow. The HTML border have been changed to be rounded, and the solid blue background changed to a gradient. All of the bases are now covered.  </p>
