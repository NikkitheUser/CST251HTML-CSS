<h1> Lab 6: More Complicated HTML</h1>
<h2> Big Idea</h2>
<p> In this lab, we learned how to implement CSS files into our HTML, and how to create forms.</p>
<h3> Challenges</h3>
The CSS file was already pre-created, so there were no issues regarding its implementation into our code. However, creating the form was more of a challange. With the introduction of new values and other coding options, new rules were established that had to be memorized. The main issue with the form was purely just correctly typing out the correct phrases combined with how time consuming it was to properly type them out.
<h4> results</h4>
<p>With the CSS file, the usally drab looking HTML file gets a noticable upgrade. The background is a light gray, the font changed, and there is also a border. An HTML file is considered the basic structure, while the CSS gives it the final coat of paint. The form portion of the lab ended up working smoothly. The borrowed Google search-engine works, along with the bubble options and the drop down menu as well.
