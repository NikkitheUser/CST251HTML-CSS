  <h2>Challlenge</h2>

<p>For this lab we have to copy an exisiting website to the best of our abilities. From the layout to the font style, we have to get it as close to the real thing as possible. For this activity, I've elected to use the front page of "Ginventory" as my muse. Doing this will require me to find the correct font, make images transparent and to properly put elements in the proper position.</p>
  <h3>Problems</h3>
<p> This is far from an easy lab. In my case, I was regularly frustrated by my own coding ability. while getting my elements to change color, opacity and font was simple enough, there were complications. Keeping all of my elements in one position was surprisingly difficult, it took hours to get elements in their place. An issue that is still a problem, if a user has a different sized screen, then the html can't properly resize itself.</p>
  <h4>Results</h4>
<p> On the surface, the html website looks correct enough. However, if a user resizes their screen, then the HTML just ends up looking jumbled. images leave the background, words are off screen. I still need to learn and understand how to keep elements from slipping during a resizing.</p>
