 	 	<h1> Lab 16: Fancy CSS 2</h1>
 	 </head>
  <h2>Challlenge</h2>

<p> As a continuation of last lab, we have to implement new CSS codes into our html. For this round, we have to add in animations, transitions, columns and a background image. This will require a lot of lines of code and patience as well. </p>
  <h3>Problems</h3>
<p> Getting the columns to work was a breeze. However all the other fancy elements proved to be a challange. The transitions took time, I had to go through different modications to transitions to figure out what I've done wrong, since certain transitions require certain codes. Animation took a while, as I did take the w3schools code and altered it slightly. The animation somehow kept changing the overall layout of the website. What was the hardest thing to do, was the background image. No matter what I've done and where I placed it, the background refused to show. I placed it as a div, in the body, the html and so forth. I ended shoving it in the HTML to get it to finally work.</p>
  <h4>Results</h4>
<p> The "Lab,challenge and problems" headers ended up being transitional. The "results" header has a sliding in animation. The columns on the bottom have text from the lecture. While the background is where it needs to be, and I hate that I couldn't figure out how to add it to the CSS. </p>
