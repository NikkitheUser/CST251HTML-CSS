  <h2>Challlenge</h2>
<p> In Lab 7, we have to create our own CSS file. Margins, borders and the background color have to be edited. That also goes for changing outher atributes as well.</p>
  <h3>Problems</h3>
<p> The problems that we ran into stem from the unfamiliar territory. It is not a perfect mirrior of HTML, there are new rules that we had to implement before we could start creating a CSS file. Time consumption along with trial and error were reoccuring issues.</p>
  <h4>Results</h4>
<p>After a oddly long struggle, the CSS file was completed. We shoved in the CSS file into our usual Index.HTML, and the .HTML displayed it's new look. The CSS gave the HTML 'style' instead of a bland structual based website.  </p>
