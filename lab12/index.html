  <h2>Challlenge</h2>

<p>With this block styling lab, we must understand how to arrange and position our elements. Images and paragraphs will be moved around, from being centered to floating towards the right most of the html. </p>
  <h3>Problems</h3>
<p> Blocking elements are a bit complicated to get a handle on, and will require a lot of time and patience to get it down. that being said, the three out of the four elements did give me a difficult time. the floating text would seemingly refuse to stay on the right side of the page, and finally moved to the right randomly. while the two images kept overlapping eachother and leaving the border. As important of a lab assignment this was, it was no doubt extremely fustrating to work with.</p>
  <h4>Results</h4>
<p> After following the directions to the lab the mess in the border on the bottom of the page is the result. Two images that are centered, the flower image is centered both horizontally and vertically. Along with two text elements, one floating the right while the other is centered with the images.  </p>
