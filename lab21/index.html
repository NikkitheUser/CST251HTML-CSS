	<h1> Lab 21: 2nd Draft Team Project Sketches</h1>

		<h1> Challenges</h1>
		<p> After creating 15 thumbnail sketches of our website, it was time to get together and decide which versions have the strongest potential. With 5 participating members, each with 15 sketches, we thought it would be incredibly difficult to chose the best. Instead the process was rather quick.</p>

		<h1> Problems</h1>
		<p> With the combined 75 thumbnail sketches, we had to come to a conclusion. Our group is made up of 4 communication design majors and one environmental studies major, our combined knowledge of coding is not impressive. So off the bat, we have to stay on a very simple route when it comes to the design. Most of my designs I showed off required a lot of coding knowhow, so most of them were shot down due to its complicity .The issue then comes to, how can we do a visually unique cooking website, but keep it simple enough that we donâ€™t overwork ourselves.

		<h1> Results</h1>
		<p>As our meeting winded down, we came to an agreement when it came to a design. The layout will be simple to produce, however the look and aesthetic can be the unique factor. Idea number one and idea number 3 are very similar to each other design wise, but their layout is different. While idea 2 has a simpler layout but has a design reminiscent of a college notebook.   </p>
